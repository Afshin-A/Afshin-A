# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my profile!
I'm a passionate Software Engineer with ~2.5 years of experience building scalable full-stack applications, driven by solving real-world problems in domains like healthcare. With a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University (2024), I specialize in crafting efficient, secure, and user-focused solutions using Angular, Python, TypeScript, AWS, and GCP. My journey began with 6 years as a Walmart Electronics Sales Associate, where I honed communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, which I now leverage to collaborate with stakeholders and deliver impactful tech solutions. Iâ€™m proactive, disciplined, and always eager to tackle complex challenges with innovative code.
